# ShadowTutorial
This is one of the tutorials that served as the practicals, for the real time 3D techniques for games modules. This one specifically involved the use of a shader to load in the data of multiple textures for the heightmap that had been loaded in the heightmap tutorial. Then using a colour map it sampled the textures and created a shaded height map, giving a more realistic view based on the colour map provided. The Shared application was provided as the starting point of the tutorial, with the focus on implementing the functionality of the shader to perform the colour map sampling and the texturing of the terrain. I have include it to keep a record of it as a reference point to move the technique over to the Direct X11 Engine.
